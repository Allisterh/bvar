\description{
FRED-QD is a quarterly frequency companion to FRED-MD, a large macroeconomic
database. It is designed to emulate the dataset used in "Disentangling the
Channels of the 2007-2009 Recession" by Stock and Watson (2012),
but also contains several additional series.
The currently included dataset is from April 2019, contains observations
from 1959Q1 until 2018Q4, and has been subset to series that either are
in public domain, or we were given permission to use.
