#' FRED-QD: Quarterly Database for Macroeconomic Research
#'
#' FRED-QD is a large macroeconomic database designed for the empirical analysis
#' of “big data”. They are updated in real-time through the FRED database. They
#' are publicly accessible, facilitating the replication of empirical work. And
#' they relieve the researcher of the task of incorporating data changes and
#' revisions (a task accomplished by the data desk at the Federal Reserve Bank
#' of St. Louis). The current version included is from April 2019 and contains
#' quarterly observations for many macroeconomic variables from Q1 1959 to Q4
#' 2018.
