Description: Toolkit for estimation of hierarchical Bayesian VARs. Implements 
prior selection for conjugate priors in the fashion of Giannone et al. (2015)  
that accounts for uncertainty about prior hyperparameters. Allows for the  
computation of impulse responses as well as forecasts based on draws of 
coefficients from their respective posterior distribution.
